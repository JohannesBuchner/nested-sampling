Lighthouse example
--------------------

A famous example problem, which can be solved with Bayesian inference. 

The position of a lighthouse is unknown. Its light is broken and shines at 
random points. We try to infer to position from where on the cost line a flash
has been detected.

Detailed problem setup: http://www.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge193.old/practicals/practical3/Lighthouse.pdf

Look at the pdf files, are they not pretty. The code does Bayesian inference
and plots posterior contours for the position of the light house. A nice exercise
is to slowly increase the number of data points and see how the posteriors behave.
This will teach you that the 1 sigma contours are not a good indicator!
