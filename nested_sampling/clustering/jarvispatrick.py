Clustering Using a Similarity Measure Based
on Shared Near Neighbors
R. A. JARVIS AND EDWARD A. PATRICK

A nonparametric clustering technique incorporating the
concept of similarity based on the sharing of near neighbors is presented.
In addition to being an essentially parallel approach, the computational
elegance of the method is such that the scheme is applicable
to a wide class of practical problems involving large sample size and high
dimensionality. No attempt is made to show how a priori problem
knowledge can be introduced into the procedure.
